This plugin provides simple access to invisible item frames.
To use:

- /invisframes <br>
This will give you one invisible frame.
- /invisframes glow <br>
Provides a glowing invisible frame.
<br>
<br>
If you are running this from a console, you must specify a player at the end.
- /invisframes <normal/glow> <playername>

<br>
And that's it.
<br>
If you want to compile the plugin yourself for some reason, just clone this repo.
You will need Gradle installed. Run 'gradlew build', and that's it. The JAR will be
in build/libs.

API is coming soon (probably, if I don't forget about this plugin).
